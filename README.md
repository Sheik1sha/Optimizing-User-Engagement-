   There is no significant difference in page views or time spent between Group A (White background) and Group B (Black background), with average page views and time spent being nearly identical for both groups.

2. **Conversion Rate**:  
   Group B (Black background) shows a significantly higher conversion rate (14.07%) compared to Group A (5.40%), indicating the Black background positively influences user actions like purchases or sign-ups.

3. **Device Analysis**:  
   Desktop users have slightly higher conversion rates (9.97%) than Mobile users (9.42%), though both devices show similar engagement in page views and time spent.

4. **Location Analysis**:  
   Users in England exhibit the highest page views (7.61), time spent (245.90 seconds), and conversion rates (10.91%), while Northern Ireland has the lowest conversion rate (8.29%).

## Recommendations
1. **Implement the Black Background Site-Wide**:  
   The Black background significantly improves conversion rates without negatively impacting page views or time spent, making it a strong candidate for site-wide implementation.

2. **Optimize the Desktop Experience**:  
   Desktop users show slightly higher conversion rates compared to mobile users. Consider further optimizing the desktop experience to maximize conversions.

3. **Focus on High-Performing Regions**:  
   Users in England exhibit the highest engagement and conversion rates. Tailor marketing campaigns and promotions to this region to further boost performance.

4. **Monitor Long-Term Impact**:  
   After implementing the Black background, monitor user behavior over time to ensure the change continues to drive positive results without unintended consequences.
